<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been actively working in the IT field for more than 7 years. I have a Networking Degree and have been providing Technical Support to a company of 200+ employees 
  for the last 6 years but have decided to expand my knowledge into the Web Development scene. 
</p>

<p>My hobbies include video games, RC cars, playing trading card games like Magic: the gathering, and any cool new technology!</p>

<p>I have always wanted to get into coding. I tend to have a high attention to detail and like solving problems, so I think it would be a fun aspect of IT 
  that I can learn and grow in.</p>
